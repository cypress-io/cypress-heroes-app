# Lab1 - Protractor Migration

Welcome to this lab on how to migrate from Protractor tests to Cypress.

To get started, checkout the `lab1-start` branch:

```
git checkout lab1-start
```

This branch is set up with a few Protractor tests ready to go. Let's run them and see how they work:

```bash title='/client'
ng e2e
```
